# Traffic Sign Detection

## Problem

The project aims to develop a model for detecting and classifying traffic signs in images, facilitating automated recognition and interpretation of traffic signals for enhanced road safety. By accurately identifying and understanding traffic signs, the model will contribute to reducing accidents, improving traffic flow, and enhancing overall road safety for both drivers and pedestrians.

## Objective

Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for  detecting and classifying traffic signs .


## Recognition method
For traffic sign recognition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed to recognize traffic signs from images, leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction and classification, as depicted in the figure below.

## Requirements
- Windows 8.1 Pro CPU
- Anaconda Distribution
- Python
- Tensorflow

## Test
Google colab link for testing [clik_here](https://github.com/sanketpatil51/taffic_sign/blob/main/code.ipynb) our model



## limitations
- It takes a lot of computer power to train and use the model.
- Limited diversity in classes may lead to difficulty in distinguishing between similar signs.
